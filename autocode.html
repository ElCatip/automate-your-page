        How the Web Works 
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
    <p><p>  The web is made of connected computers and servers talking to each other (internet infrastructure) using HTML protocol a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. Besides the HTML protocol, there are several layers of protocols, called protocol stack, that serve different functions such as application, transport, network and hardware.

        HTML
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
    <p><p>  HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web. HTML documents contain text content which describes "what you see"and markup which describes "how it looks". Standard markup language used to create web pages. It is written in the form of the HTML elements consisting of tags and bracket. HTML elements form the building blocks of all websites. Web Browsers can also refer to Cascading Style sheets to define look and layout of text and other material. The Mozilla Developer Network (aka MDN, and a good resource in general), explains key HTML vocabulary.

        Tags and Elements 
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
    <p><p>  HTML documents are made of HTML elements. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML tags.Tags are used to mark up the start and end of an HTML element. A start tag consists of an opening angle bracket followed by the element name, zero or more space separated attribute/value pairs, and a closing angle bracket.

        Inline vs Block Elements 
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
    <p><p>  HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them. Block elements are very important in creating web pages because the box is the basic building structure for all web pages. Inline styling is useful for applying a unique style to a single HTML element.

        HTML Validation

    <div class="concept-description">
    <p><p>  HTML code can be validated for standard compliance as well as suitability. Follow this link to validate HTML code: ''' http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input '''. It's important to have your code validated to insure that the web page will work on standard browsers.

        CSS

    <div class="concept-description">
    <p><p>  Cascading Style Sheets - style sheet language used to describe the look and feel of a document written in a markup language sucha as HTML.It's easy to add style using CSS- Cascading Style Sheets. CSS give programmers a way to control the style of HTML elements. Attributes can be passed or inherited using classes. Usually specified in a different file linked to the HTML file. The separation of format and content makes HTML and CSS a powerful combination of software tools.

''' https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input'''. Your CSS code may be correct but if it's not validated, it may display other unintended formats with other browsers. Icons can also be displayed which will show your page is validated.

        Code, Test, Refine
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
    <p><p>  Programming steps for creating a website can be broken down to 3 steps: Code, Test, and Refine.Ideally, think about the size and Look for natural boxes(every web page is made up of boxes). Look for repeated styles and semantics then write your HTML code. Apply styles from biggest to smallest. Fix things until web design looks as intended. Developer tool in Web browsers can be useful in debugging code.

        Python
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
    <p><p>  Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language. It is simple, easy to use and learn.Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. Following links are good references:  https://www.python.org/doc, https://docs.python.org/2/contents.html.

        Variables
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
    <p><p>  Use to store or assign info. A name is assigned a value thus the name should be descriptive and unique. You can embed variables inside a string. Note: in python and other programming languages, you cannot combine variables of different data types.

        Strings
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
    <p><p>  A sequence of characters surrounded by quotes. Can be easily manipulated, length changed, deleted, concatenated using different functions. A string can also be indexed which allows access to individual elements. Many built-in functions are available in python such as parse, format, convert, atoi, atof, etc.

        Lists
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
    <p><p>  An abstract data type that represents a sequence of values, where the same value may occur more than once. List data types are often implemented using arrays or linked lists. A list can also be part of a list or inside a list. Gets really interesting with nested lists. Lists can be used for different data structures: stack, queues, sets, dictionary.

        Function
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
    <p><p>  A function is a piece of code used to perform a 
specific task. It requires an input, a process, and an output.
Making a function involves definition and receiving of parameters. 
Programmers can avoid repetition by calling the function for 
repetitive tasks. This eliminates having to write code for each call. Biggest benefit is ability to break down big problems into chunks and code portability. Python like other programming languages have built in functions. See following link for more info on built in functions:  https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html

        Control FLow If and While
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
    <p><p>  Decision processes are simplified with control flow mechanisms such as IF and While. For higher number of processes, while loops are best to use. While loops allow processes to continue until condition is met and while loops terminate at that point, otherwise it goes into infinite loops.

        Structured data
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
    <p><p>  Program is written so a specific process or routine is created separately. Modular structure allows coding without having to repeat code. Rewriting code should be avoided because it could lead to more errors and difficulty in debugging. Modular construction also allows rapid changes because one style change is applied to all sections. Plus it looks better if the webpage has the same look and feel.

        Mutability

    <p><p>  The ability to change data in lists. Mutable data can be manipulated and passed on between calls. Mutable sequences can be changed after they are created. Depending on class hierarchy, data can be mutable or immutable as in cannot be changed (constant). Strings are immutable.

        Debugging Strategy

    <div class="concept-description">
    <p><p>  Examine error messages when programs crash. Work from example code. Make sure examples work. Check (print) intermediate results ( assert variables -- best debugging tool). Keep and compare old versions. Best source of info when debugging code: http://stackoverflow.com/

    <p><p>  Keeping data separated from its visual presentation facilitates changes. Keep the raw text in one place and the visual presentation elsewhere.This makes it easier to incorporate changes or to isolate errors.

        How to think like a programmer
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
    <p><p>  Understand the requirements of the problem -- inputs and outputs. Plan an approach to solving the problem. Re-familiarize yourself with code you've already written that maybe useful in solving the problem. Write new code to solve other pieces of the problem. Put all the pieces together.
